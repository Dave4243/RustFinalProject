Project Introduction: Creating a ML algorithm to recognise handwritten numbers. We chose this project because ML is cool, difficult, and useful.

Goals:
  - Create ML model to recognize handwritten numbers
  - Understand how the parts of a neural network work
Objectives:
  - Make a CLI for testing/running
  - Create functions such as gradient descent, backpropagation, normalizing output, scoring model, etc.

Technical Overview
  - Reading from custom file type (ubyte file)
    - Each file has 28x28 of 1 byte pixels
  - Backpropagation
  - Gradient descent
  - Layer strcture made of nodes
  - Custom file type for storing models
  - Training Models

Checkpoints:
11/4 - 11/8
  - Understanding backpropagation
  - Make cli (at least have design down)
  - Normalize output function
  - Write score function (how well the model does at guessing the number)

11/18 - 11/22
  - Have file reading/writing function
  - Have something that can run
  - Start training model

Possible Challenges:
  - Deciding on file format for storing model
  - Understanding the concepts in ML
  - Creating the activation function
  - DEBUGGING
